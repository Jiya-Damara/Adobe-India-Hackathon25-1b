## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker with CPU support
- Python 3.10+ (for local execution)

### Build & Run

1. **Docker Execution (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Build optimized container
   docker build -t persona-doc-intelligence .
   
   # Run intelligent processing
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app persona-doc-intelligence
   ```

2. **Shell Script Execution:**
   ```bash
   # Make executable and run
   chmod +x build-and-test.sh
   ./build-and-test.sh
   ```

3. **Direct Python Execution:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Run enhanced processing
   python process_pdfs_enhanced.py
   ```

### Input/Output

**Input:** Configured persona and job contexts in `challenge1b_input.json` files
**Output:** Intelligent content rankings in `challenge1b_output.json` files

**Example Output Format:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "input_documents": ["document1.pdf", "document2.pdf"],
    "persona": "Food Contractor",
    "job_to_be_done": "Prepare a vegetarian buffet dinner menu",
    "processing_timestamp": "2025-07-28T19:40:24.784320",
    "total_sections_analyzed": 175
  },
  "extracted_sections": [
    {
      "document": "Recipe_Guide.pdf",
      "section_title": "Banchan",
      "importance_rank": 1,
      "page_number": 2
    }

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### Advanced Intelligence Pipeline

Our solution goes beyond basic text extraction, employing:

- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines TF-IDF semantic similarity (40%) with hierarchical keyword matching (60%)
- **Persona-Driven Analysis**: Three-tier keyword systems (high/medium/low priority) with weighted scoring
- **Context-Aware Filtering**: Document-job alignment bonuses and irrelevant content penalties
- **Quality Maximization**: Meaningful section titles, refined text extraction, comprehensive metadata

### Validated Intelligence Results

1. **Travel Planner**: "Ultimate Guide to Activities" ranks #1 for group trip planning
2. **HR Professional**: "Manage list items" and "Create/Share Link" rank top for form creation
3. **Food Contractor**: "Banchan", "Polenta", "Agedashi Tofu" rank #1-3 for vegetarian dinner
4. **Intelligence Verification**: Meat dishes penalized to rank #78+ for vegetarian requirements

### Performance Optimizations

- **CPU-Only Processing**: Optimized scikit-learn implementation with efficient sparse matrices
- **Memory Management**: Sequential processing with intelligent batching (<200MB peak)
